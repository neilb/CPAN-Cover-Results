=head1 NAME

CPAN::Cover::Results - get CPAN coverage test results from CPAN Cover service

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use CPAN::Cover::Results;

 my $iterator = CPAN::Cover::Results->new()->iterator();

 while (my $release = $iterator->next) {
     printf "%s (%s) : %.2f\n",
            $release->distname, $dist->version,
            $dist->total;
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will get the coverage test results from the
L<CPAN Cover|http://cpancover.com>
service and let you iterate over them, distribution by distribution.
CPAN Cover is a service that runs L<Devel::Cover>
on as much of CPAN as possible,
and makes the results available.

The release iterator returns instances of L<CPAN::Cover::Results::Release>,
which has the following attributes:

=over 4

=item * distname - the name of the distribution, as determined
by L<CPAN::DistnameInfo>.

=item * version - the version number of the release.

=item * branch - the branch coverage of the release's testsuite,
or C<undef>.

=item * condition - the condition coverage figure, or C<undef>.

=item * pod - the pod coverage, if available, or C<undef>.

=item * statement - the statement coverage, or C<undef>.

=item * subroutine - the subroutine coverage, or C<undef>.

=item * total - the total coverage.

See the L<Devel::Cover> documentation for more information on the
different coverage figures.
